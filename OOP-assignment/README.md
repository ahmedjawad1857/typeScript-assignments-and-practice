# TypeScript OOP Assignments

## Question 1: Class Inheritance

Create a base class called `Animal` with properties `name` and `sound`. Then, create a derived class called `Dog` that extends `Animal` and has an additional property `breed`. Display the name, sound, and breed of the dog.

## Question 2: Overriding Methods

Extend the `Dog` class from the previous question. Add a method called `makeSound` to the `Animal` class that logs the sound of the animal. Override this method in the `Dog` class to log "Woof" as the sound.

## Question 3: Abstract Class

Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea`. Implement two classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that extend `Shape` and provide implementations for `calculateArea`.

## Question 4: Interfaces

Create an interface `Employee` with properties `name`, `id`, and `salary`. Implement a class called `Manager` that implements the `Employee` interface and sets the properties accordingly.

## Question 5: Interface Inheritance

Extend the `Employee` interface from the previous question to include a method `getDetails`. Implement this method in the `Manager` class to display the details of the manager.

## Question 6: Multiple Inheritance

Create an interface called `Person` with properties `firstName` and `lastName`. Implement a class `Student` that implements both `Person` and `Employee` interfaces from previous questions. Display the student's and employee's details.

## Question 7: Super Keyword

Create a base class `Vehicle` with properties `make` and `model`. Implement a derived class `Car` that extends `Vehicle` and adds a property `color`. Use the `super` keyword to call the base class constructor and set properties.

## Question 8: Access Modifiers

Create a class `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. Make `name` private and `age` protected. Implement a method to display the person's details.

## Question 9: Method Overriding

Create a base class `Shape` with a method `draw`. Implement two derived classes `Circle` and `Square` that override the `draw` method to display their respective shapes.
