## Map (Double the Numbers):

- Given an array of numbers [3, 7, 11, 15], use the map() method to create a new array containing each number doubled.

## Filter (Even Numbers):

- Given an array of integers [4, 9, 16, 21, 30], use the filter() method to extract an array of even numbers.

## Some (Positive Numbers Check):

- Given an array of integers [-5, -3, 0, 2, 4], use the some() method to check if there's at least one positive number.

## Every (Greater than 18):

- Given an array of ages [22, 19, 25, 30], use the every() method to verify if all ages are greater than 18.

## Reduce (Sum of Squares):

- Given an array of numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], use the reduce() method to calculate the sum of the squares of each number.

## Map (String Lengths):

- Given an array of strings ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], use the map() method to create a new array containing the lengths of each string.

## Filter (Prime Numbers):

- Given an array of integers [7, 14, 23, 30, 37], use the filter() method to extract an array of prime numbers.

## Some (Even Numbers Check):

- Given an array of integers [3, 9, 11, 14, 21], use the some() method to check if there's at least one even number.

## Every (String Lengths Check):

- Given an array of words ['dog', 'cat', 'elephant', 'lion'], use the every() method to verify if all words have more than 3 characters.

## Reduce (Product of Positives):

- Given an array of numbers [-2, 3, -4, 5, -6], use the reduce() method to calculate the product of all positive numbers.

## Map (Uppercase Conversion):

- Given an array of names ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], use the map() method to create a new array containing the names in uppercase.

## Filter (Long Words):

- Given an array of words ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi'], use the filter() method to extract an array of words with more than 5 characters.

## Some (Multiple of 5 Check):

- Given an array of numbers [12, 27, 35, 42, 50], use the some() method to check if there's at least one number that's a multiple of 5.

## Every (Even Numbers Check):

- Given an array of integers [2, 8, 16, 22, 30], use the every() method to verify if all numbers are even.

## Reduce (Total Age):

- Given an array of objects with names and ages [{ name: 'Alice', age: 25 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }], use the reduce() method to calculate the total age of all people.
